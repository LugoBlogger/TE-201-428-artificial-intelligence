You can answer in English or Bahasa Indonesia. If you insert some images
to your markdown file, please use relative path and submit your work 
in a compressed file `.zip`.


You may use ChatGPT, but be careful that it may give you a false answer 
and sometimes it is hallucinated. The point of learning is to understand what you write. 
Without understanding your answer by yourself, this assignment is useless.

[**Notice**]: If you submit your answer in a compressed file, please make
sure that after you have done the compression, extract the compressed file
to make sure that you have compresed the right files.
